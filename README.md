# Polaris
Explore the world in Microsoft Flight Simulator by visiting random locations!

## Usage
Visiting a random location in Flight Simulator is as easy as 1-2-3!

1. Launch Microsoft Flight Simulator
2. Load a flight
3. Launch Polaris and click the "New Location" button

> **Note:** When you visit a new location using Polaris, it may take some time for Flight Simulator to load the terrain, and in that period your aircraft may move erratically.

It is recommended that you disable aircraft crash damage when using Polaris.  You can do so in Microsoft Flight Simulator by going to Options → Assistance Options → Failure and Damage → Crash Damage and changing the toggle to DISABLED.

## Requirements
- Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020)
- [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) (this may already be installed on your computer)
